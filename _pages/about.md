Welcome to Xiaoyu's personal homepage!

I am currently a Postdoc Associate in the Division of Systems Engineering at Boston University (BU), working with [Prof. Christos G. Cassandras](https://christosgcassandras.org/), [Prof. Roberto Tron](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/roberto-tron/), and [Prof. Wenchao Li](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/wenchao-li-ph-d/). Before joining BU, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2024. My Ph.D. supervisor was [Prof. Jianping He](https://iwin-fins.com/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Department of Automation from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2019, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiqiang Zuo](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1013/1586.htm). My research interests mainly include the security of cyber-physical systems, cooperative control and reinforcement learning of multi-agent systems, as well as their practical applications to multi-robot systems and traffic systems.
