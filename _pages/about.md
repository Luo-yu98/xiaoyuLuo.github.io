Welcome to Xiaoyu's personal homepage!

I am currently a Postdoc Associate in the College of Engineering at Boston University, working with [Prof. Christos G. Cassandras](https://christosgcassandras.org/), [Prof. Roberto Tron](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/roberto-tron/), and [Prof. Wenchao Li](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/wenchao-li-ph-d/). Prior to this, I received the B.E. degree (Supervisor: [Prof. Zhiqiang Zuo](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1013/1586.htm)) in the Department of Automation from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2019 and the Ph.D. degree (Supervisor: [Prof. Jianping He](https://iwin-fins.com/)) in Control Science and Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2024, respectively. My research interests mainly include the security of cyber-physical systems, learning and control of multi-agent systems, as well as their practical applications to multi-robot systems and traffic systems.
